    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h2><p>The complexity of manually and dynamic testing increases with the growth of the project. This results in the increasing usage of static analysis tools, such as bounded model checker, which do not require compilation and act automatically [1]. As an SMT-based model checker for program static analysis and verification, ESBMC has been successfully used in a variety of environments due to its adaptability to multi-language, multi-platform and high efficiency[2]. However, these features have led to the difficulty of fuzzing this software verifier. Firstly, the construction of a generation-based fuzzer for ESBMC is a challenge. The adaptability for multiple source programming languages means that the fuzzer needs to consider certain source language’s grammar, in the worst case, constructing different inputs for corresponding front-ends. Secondly, the construction of a coverage-guided mutation-based fuzzer is a challenge, as directly generated random input cannot be “understood” by ESBMC and will be excluded beyond validating. These deficiencies will result in fuzzy tests that do not detect errors hidden in the deep execution path of the program and insufficient code coverage. Hence, we propose a fuzzer construction on intermediate representation, which refers to Goto programs. Instead of converting from the source file, this generic fuzzer would generate syntactically correct Goto programs directly. The introduction of mutation will further dynamically modify the properties in the Goto programs by tracking and updating the corpus. These Goto programs will finally be used as input to fuzz test the ESBMC.</p><p>The achievement of this goal can be divided into the following steps: (1) Summarise the syntax grammar for constructing Goto intermediate representation, including the symbol table and Goto instructions, i.e. each statement in the Goto program, as well as the Goto programs itself. (2) Investigate a mutation approach for the generated Goto programs, which will be achieved by introducing libFuzzer[3]. (3) Design and implement the program architecture of the Goto-fuzzer. (4) Debugging and testing, including error detection and performance testing. (5) Fuzz the ESBMC by Goto-fuzzer. Collect the error logs and coverage information.(6) Analyse the data and draw conclusions.</p><h2 id="Background">2. Background</h2><h3 id="ESBMC">2.1. ESBMC</h3><p>ESBMC is a licensed open-source SMT-based contextual boundary model checker that has been widely used to verify multi-language programs, including C&#x2F;C++, Java and Solidity. ESBMC can automatically find memory safety and assertion violations[4]. The basic workflow of this bounded model checker begins with a transition system $M$, a property $φ$, and a bound $k$. ESBMC unwinds the system $k$ times and converts it into a verification condition (VC) $ψ$. ESBMC checks the negation of this VC so that $ψ$ is satisfiable if and only if $φ$ has a counterexample of depth $k$ or less. To cope with increasing software complexity, sorts of SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers have been used as the back-end of ESBMC for solving the generated VCs[5].</p><p>From an architectural point of view, ESBMC can be divided into three components: front-end, middleware and back-end. A C++ Oriented ESBMC structure can been shown by Figure 1.</p><center><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/a0a87206/3.svg"></center><center><b>FIGURE 1</b> C++ oriented ESBMC's architecture overview. White rectangles represent input and output; grey rectangles represent the steps of the verification</center><h4 id="Front-end">2.1.1. Front-end</h4><p>Front-end is an important piece of technology that should facilitate the transition between the program under verification and a format the tool can work upon. Despite that several front-ends have been constructed corresponding to different programming languages in ESBMC，the final output will always be a symbol table, an auxiliary data structure storing the meaning and range of variable names. A general front-end framework includes a pre-processor, scanner, parser and type checker. <strong>Pre-processor</strong> handles special operations that will be performed according to the preprocessor instructions, such as replacement or expansion macros [6]. A lexical analysis of the <strong>scanner</strong> and a syntax score of the <strong>parser</strong> resulted in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) [7]. To simplify the analysis, ASTs have been converted into a simpler form, called an intermediate representation (IR), by <strong>type checker</strong> in which a symbol table is generated simultaneously. At this point, the source code as input is converted into symbol tables [8].  </p><h4 id="Middleware">2.1.2. Middleware</h4><p>In ESBMC, the generated symbol table enables the middleware to perform further actions, including the conversion from the original program into the equivalent Goto program, an intermediate representation generated from the symbol table, the generation of the single static assignment (SSA) form and the symbolical execution of the program.</p><p><strong>Goto Converter</strong> firstly AST into its Control flow chart form, which refers to Goto programs. These programs are language independent and similar to the intermediate languages of many compilers. Each program is a list of instructions, each of which has the type of instruction (one of 19 instructions), a code expression, a protection expression and possibly some target for the next instruction. An <strong>Instructions Type</strong> is an enum value describing the action performed by this instruction. <strong>Guard</strong> is an (arbitrarily complex) expression (usually an expert) of Boolean type. And <strong>Code</strong> represents a code statement, which can be seen as a unit in the symbol table. The type field determines the meaning of an instruction node, while the guard and code fields are used for a variety of purposes by different types of instructions [9].</p><p><strong>Symbolic Engine</strong> will firstly convert the variables from program text to a single static assignment (SSA) form. New variables are created to identify branch and loop entry conditions. These variables will guard the assignments based on the branch taken [4]. Symbolic execution will be performed after the conversion to perform semantic analysis, including dynamic memory checks (bounds, memory alignment, offset pointer-free, and double-free) and unwinding assertions. The point of this step is to make sure each assignment is independent.[8] </p><h4 id="Back-end">2.1.3. Back-end</h4><p>During this workflow, two sets of SMT formulae are created based on the SSA expressions. We denote $C$ for the constraints and $P$ for the properties. These quantifier-free formulae will be used as input for the SMT solver, a counterexample will be created if there exists a violation of a given property, or an unsatisfiable answer if the property holds [4]. </p><h3 id="Fuzzing">2.2. Fuzzing</h3><p>Fuzz testing (fuzzing) is a software testing technique. The core idea is to feed random data generated automatically into a program by a fuzzer. Traditionally, fuzzers can be classified into two categories based on how they are input, including generation-based fuzzers and coverage-guided mutation-based fuzzers.</p><h4 id="Generation-Based-Fuzzer">2.2.1. Generation-Based Fuzzer</h4><p>A <strong>generation-based</strong> fuzzer construct inputs according to some provided format specification, especially the grammar of a language[11]. One of the good examples of such fuzzers is <strong>Csmith</strong> [10] which is already applied in ESBMC. Csmith works as a generator for C programs. These programs will be fed to the target software, in most cases compilers, run the executables and compare the outputs. In practice, it is used as a stress testing tool to check the stability of ESBMC.</p><h4 id="Mutation-Based-Fuzzer">2.2.2. Mutation-Based Fuzzer</h4><p>A <strong>mutation-based</strong> fuzzer generates inputs by randomly altering analyst-supplied or created seeds.<br>These programmes do not require syntactic definitions and are not limited to a single input type [11]. These coverage-guided fuzzers use coverage information as feedback to alter existing inputs into new ones, attempting to maximise the amount of code covered by the overall input corpus. </p><p><strong>LibFuzzer</strong> is a powerful mutation-based Fuzzer chosen as our research object. LibFuzzer is linked to the library under test and feeds fuzzed inputs to it through a defined fuzzing target function. The fuzzer records which branches of the code were accessed and creates mutations on the corpus of input data to optimise code coverage. LLVM’s SanitizerCoverage instrumentation provides code coverage information for libFuzzer. [3]</p><h4 id="Structure-Aware-Fuzzer">2.2.3. Structure-Aware Fuzzer</h4><p>Both fuzzer types mentioned above are inherently flawed. On one hand, A generation-based fuzzer lacks a coverage-guided trace-feedback mechanism, which leads to possible duplication of the generated test cases. Another common flaw in generation-based testing occurs when the input is required to fulfil sophisticated semantic validity criteria that are not explicitly evaluated by the generator [13]. On the other hand, the presence of checksums in the input format or the complexity of the input format itself can easily trip up a mutation-based fuzzer, as virtually all generated inputs can be invalid for the target data structure.</p><p>We, therefore, consider a <strong>structure-aware</strong> fuzzer proposed by Google [12]. This fuzzer is a combination of the two fuzzing approaches described above: as a generation-based fuzzer in essence, the generator will now accept random value generated by the mutation-based fuzzer as seed. This mutator, in this case, libFuzzer, will mutate and optimise the random bytes by tracking and feedback.</p><h2 id="Research-Methodology">3. Research Methodology</h2><p>This section is originally divided into three subsections, with Section 3.1 discussing the introduction and application of structure-aware fuzzer to ESBMC, after which two approaches are proposed. We will first introduce the first approach in Section 3.2, which uses Csmith as a generator, and then mutates the original program via libFuzzer. We will discuss this method and explain why the second approach was chosen. In Section 3.2, we will t describe the second approach that will be used in development.</p><h3 id="Introduce-Structure-Aware-fuzzer-to-ESBMC">3.1. Introduce Structure-Aware fuzzer to ESBMC</h3><p>First, we need to decide the output form of the fuzzer, in this case, the generator. In theory, the potential object can be any temporary variable passed in the ESBMC workflow. We have chosen the Goto program as the output for several reasons: (1) the Goto program is language-independent, reflected in no dependency on the front-end (2) Goto program is a demarcation between syntax and semantics. As described in Section 2.1.2, symbolic execution represents the input to a program symbolically, based on constraints obtained by analysing the semantics of the program, whilst the semantics in the program will be translated and executed. The correctness of both syntax and semantics is required in and beyond this component, yet previously only the syntax was required. The main goal, therefore, is to create semantically arbitrary, in most cases incorrect, but syntactically correct goto programs.</p><p>Next, we explore how to achieve randomness via mutation. We use structure-aware mutations to look for interesting input structures in the space of valid inputs, which is mirrored in the Goto program’s randomization of the structure between instructions. We also use structure-preserving mutations to create distinct mutations of the same input structure to investigate alternative execution trails. This is accomplished by making the values of context-sensitive variables unequal [13].</p><p>As shown in Figure 2, we take a simple goto program as an example, where we can make the assignment to x precede its definition by changing the order between instructions; in addition, we can break the contextual relationship between the target of the GOTO instruction and the LABEL instruction by making their values no longer equal, thus changing the semantics without violating the syntax grammar rules.  that the changes of names or values of variables would predictably be unhelpful.</p><center><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/a0a87206/4.svg"></center><center><b>FIGURE 2</b> A simple Goto program</center><h3 id="First-Approach-Csmith-Mutation-Fuzzer">3.2.

White rectangles represent components reused from ESBMC; grey rectangles represent new created components</center><p>We propose the first implementation approach, whose architecture is shown in Figure 2. First, Csmith will create random C files, which will be passed through a front-end and a converter to form Goto programs. Here we introduce a mutator which semantically randomizing Goto programs by libFuzzer. Randonmized goto programs will finally be deliverred to the subsequent process. A simplified version of the programming logic is shown in Figure 4.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">extern</span> <span class="string">&quot;C&quot;</span> <span class="function"><span class="type">int</span> <span class="title">LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">uint8_t</span> *Data, <span class="type">size_t</span> Size, string filepath)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    Goto_program=<span class="built_in">c2goto</span>(filepath);  <span class="comment">// Convert C codes to Goto programs</span></span><br><span class="line">    Goto_program=<span class="built_in">mutateor</span>(Goto_program, Data,size)  <span class="comment">// randomise Goto programs by libFuzzer</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">do_bmc</span>(Goto_program);   <span class="comment">// Apply the Goto program to the subsequent process</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="number">0</span>;  </span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><center><b>FIGURE 4</b> Programming Logic of Csmith-Mutation Fuzzer</center><p>The advantage of the Csmith-Mutation Fuzzer is that it can reuse the existing generator Csmith and only need to consider constructing a mutator; however, it also has several drawbacks: (1) We cannot guarantee that all language features supported within ESBMC are covered, as Csmith’s C standard support is c99 while that of ESBMC is c11. This will result in some of the statements not being covered during fuzz testing; (2) The fuzzer cannot be refined to test for specific statements (3) The approach of Csmith fuzzing is still front-end related as C file can only be read in via C-based front-end (in this case clang). We would like to have a more generic, front-end-independent fuzzer.</p><h3 id="Second-Approach-Goto-Fuzzer">3.3. Second Approach: Goto-Fuzzer</h3><center><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/a0a87206/1.svg"></center><center><b>FIGURE 5</b> Goto-fuzzer architecture. White rectangles represent components reused from ESBMC; grey rectangles represent new created components</center><p>Here we propose a second approaches, the architecture of which is shown in Figure 5. The core difference between two methods is that the construction output of the generator has changed from a source file to an intermediate file, which refers to the symbol. The choice of the symbol table over the goto program as the output of the generator is more a matter of development convenience, as no direct functions to construct a Goto program are provided in ESBMC. In contrast, the construction of a code statement is considerably simpler. In addition, contextual properties are initialised automatically during the conversion from symbol table to goto program, which will be a tough task if building Goto program directly. To ensure that the symbol table based generator works indentically as the direct goto program generator，We will prove that the types of generated statement will cover that of goto program instruction during the Goto converson. A simplified version of the programming implementation is shown in Figure 6.</p><figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">extern</span> <span class="string">&quot;C&quot;</span> <span class="function"><span class="type">int</span> <span class="title">LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput</span><span class="params">(<span class="type">const</span> <span class="type">uint8_t</span> *Data, <span class="type">size_t</span> Size)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    Goto_program = <span class="built_in">generator</span>(Data, Size);    <span class="comment">// use libFuzzer as seed generator </span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="built_in">do_bmc</span>(Goto_program);</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="number">0</span>;  </span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><center><b>FIGURE 6</b> Programming Logic of Goto-Fuzzer</center><h2 id="Ethics-and-professional-considerations">4. Ethics and professional considerations</h2><p>This project does not require the participation of any volunteers, nor will user data be collected in any form， the involvement of humans and data can therefore be excluded. Considering that ESBMC is under the Apache License 2.0, our modifications and development should follow the same open-source rules. In addition, given that ESBMC will be used in commercial and other production environments, the fuzzer needs to be tested before it is released, and the project documentation needs to be supplemented with relevant notes.</p><h2 id="Risk-consideration">5. Risk consideration</h2><h3 id="Design-Stage">5.1. Design Stage</h3><p>To design an efficient structure-awared fuzzer, which is the combination of generation and mutation fuzzer, will be the first challenge. This will have a direct impact on the final outcome. For example, test cases generated from a mutation algorithm that lacks logic may have the following problems: (1) the test cases are not useful, which is often reflected in the simplicity of the test cases (2) the test cases are virtually identical to others from the aspect of code coverage, which will result in test objects being limited to only some branches. </p><h3 id="Implement-Stage">5.2. Implement Stage</h3><p>The difficulty of the implement of Goto-fuzzer can be reflected in several aspects. Coupling and component independence needed to be firstly considered at the top-level design stage in order to avoid fuzzer having side effects on other functions in ESBMC. In addition, although the data structures and libraries for the intermediate representation were already provided, there was still a lot of coding to be done. Furthermore, the complex internal cross-referencing within ESBMC and the use of “magic” functions put the developer’s C++ reading skills to the test.</p><h3 id="Debug-and-Test-Stage">5.3. Debug and Test Stage</h3><p>The debuging and testing of Goto-fuzzer will be challenge, as the interdependencies of the libraries make debugging Goto-fuzzer as time consuming as debugging the entire ESBMC, requiring recompilation and relinking of the entire ESBMC project.</p><h2 id="Project-evaluation">6. Project evaluation</h2><p>The project can be evaluated from the following aspects: First, the primary purpose of a fuzzer is to use it to find hidden bugs in the program, thus the ability of error detection will be tested. One possible approach is to quantify the statistics of distinct crash errors found, rates of the crash and wrong-code errors from different versions of ESBMC, as well as the statistics of Bug-Finding Performance as a function of test-case size [14]. What’s more, the improvement of code coverage will be measured. Tools for statistical code coverage are provided in ESBMC and can be output visually. In the worst-case scenario, where our Goto fuzzer fails to find any bug, then the code coverage will be the key evaluation of the effectiveness. Besides, despite the libFuzzer as the mutator being a pre-requisite for the project, we could also propose other mutation-based fuzzer to compare and evaluate their relative performance. This optional task will be done if possible.</p><h2 id="Planning">7. Planning</h2><p>As the stage division in the section above, the general arrangement of this project will be divided into four parts, as shown in the Gantt Chart in Figure 5. First, the design stage will take 2 weeks and will be devoted mainly to summarizing the syntax grammar for the generator and to working out how to apply mutation to this fuzzer. Second, the implementation stage will last a month, and this stage will complete all. As an optional arrangement, we consider building an additional interface to output the goto program for debugging purposes. This task will be cancelled due to insufficient time. Third, the debug and testing stage will take three weeks, during which we focus on collecting data to verify the effectiveness of our Goto fuzzer. Finally, the writing stage will begin with the design stage simultaneously and will continue until August 8th .</p><center><img loading="lazy" src="/posts/a0a87206/5.png"></center><center><b>FIGURE 7</b> Gantt Chart</center><h2 id="Reference">8.

    <summary type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;Introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complexity of manually and dynamic testing increases with the growth of the project. This results in the increasing usage of static analysis tools, such as bounded model checker, which do not require compilation and act automatically [1]. As an SMT-based model checker for program static analysis and verification, ESBMC has been successfully used in a variety of environments due to its adaptability to multi-language, multi-platform and high efficiency[2]. However, these features have led to the difficulty of fuzzing this software verifier. Firstly, the construction of a generation-based fuzzer for ESBMC is a challenge. The adaptability for multiple source programming languages means that the fuzzer needs to consider certain source language’s grammar, in the worst case, constructing different inputs for corresponding front-ends. Secondly, the construction of a coverage-guided mutation-based fuzzer is a challenge, as directly generated random input cannot be “understood” by ESBMC and will be excluded beyond validating. These deficiencies will result in fuzzy tests that do not detect errors hidden in the deep execution path of the program and insufficient code coverage. Hence, we propose a fuzzer construction on intermediate representation, which refers to Goto programs. Instead of converting from the source file, this generic fuzzer would generate syntactically correct Goto programs directly. The introduction of mutation will further dynamically modify the properties in the Goto programs by tracking and updating the corpus. These Goto programs will finally be used as input to fuzz test the ESBMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The achievement of this goal can be divided into the following steps: (1) Summarise the syntax grammar for constructing Goto intermediate representation, including the symbol table and Goto instructions, i.e. each statement in the Goto program, as well as the Goto programs itself. (2) Investigate a mutation approach for the generated Goto programs, which will be achieved by introducing libFuzzer[3]. (3) Design and implement the program architecture of the Goto-fuzzer. (4) Debugging and testing, including error detection and performance testing. (5) Fuzz the ESBMC by Goto-fuzzer. Collect the error logs and coverage information.(6) Analyse the data and draw conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Background&quot;&gt;2. Background&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;ESBMC&quot;&gt;2.1. ESBMC&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESBMC is a licensed open-source SMT-based contextual boundary model checker that has been widely used to verify multi-language programs, including C&amp;#x2F;C++, Java and Solidity. ESBMC can automatically find memory safety and assertion violations[4]. The basic workflow of this bounded model checker begins with a transition system $M$, a property $φ$, and a bound $k$. ESBMC unwinds the system $k$ times and converts it into a verification condition (VC) $ψ$. ESBMC checks the negation of this VC so that $ψ$ is satisfiable if and only if $φ$ has a counterexample of depth $k$ or less. To cope with increasing software complexity, sorts of SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers have been used as the back-end of ESBMC for solving the generated VCs[5].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an architectural point of view, ESBMC can be divided into three components: front-end, middleware and back-end. A C++ Oriented ESBMC structure can been shown by Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;expr_ids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Goto-Instruction&quot;&gt;2. Goto Instruction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ESBMC, a goto instruction (&lt;code&gt;goto_programt::instructiont&lt;/code&gt;) is defined by &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; properties– The meaning of an instruction depends on the &lt;strong&gt;instruction_type&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;code&gt;goto_program_instruction_typet&lt;/code&gt;) field, while different kinds of instructions make use of the fields &lt;strong&gt;guard&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;code&gt;expr2tc&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;code&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;code&gt;expr2tc&lt;/code&gt;) for different purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In other words, these are the properties that need to be considered when initialising a goto-instruction data structure, any other property could be set default or generated afterwards. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;expr2tc&lt;/code&gt; is basically a reference pointer container for &lt;code&gt;expr2t&lt;/code&gt;. In this situation, there is no need to distinguish these two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syntax grammar can be roughly listed as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plaintext&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;Instruction ::= &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;            |   (instruction_type)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;            |   (instruction_type, guard)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;            |   (instruction_type, code)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;instruction_type&lt;/strong&gt;: an enum value describing the action performed by this instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plaintext&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;instruction_type    ::=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   NO_INSTRUCTION_TYPE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   GOTO            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   ASSUME          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   ASSERT          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   OTHER           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   SKIP            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   LOCATION        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   END_FUNCTION   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   ATOMIC_BEGIN    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   ATOMIC_END      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   RETURN         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   ASSIGN         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   DECL           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   DEAD           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   FUNCTION_CALL   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   THROW          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   CATCH          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   THROW_DECL      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;                    |   THROW_DECL_END&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;li&gt;SMT将SAT推广到涉及 实数 、 整数 和&amp;#x2F;或各种 数据结构 （如 列表 、 数组 、 位向量 和 字符串&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;由于布尔可满足性已经是 NP 完全的，所以 SMT 问题通常是 NP困难的 ，并且对于许多理论来说它是 不可判定(nondeterministic)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMT是指另外一类公式的可满足性判定问题。这一类公式具有两个特点：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;在命题逻辑公式里面混入了一些一阶逻辑表达式&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;具有任意的布尔结构&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAT solvers are automatic and efficient&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, systems are usually designed and modeled at a higher level than the Boolean level and the translation to Boolean logic can be expensive. &lt;strong&gt;A primary goal of research in Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) is to create verification engines that can reason natively at a higher level of abstraction, while still retaining the speed and automation of today’s Boolean engines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In propositional calculus a literal is simply a propositional variable or its negation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In predicate calculus a literal is an atomic formula or its negation, where an atomic formula is a predicate symbol applied to some terms, ${\displaystyle P(t_{1},\ldots ,t_{n})}$ with the terms recursively defined starting from constant symbols, variable symbols, and function symbols. For example,  ${\displaystyle \neg Q(f(g(x),y,2),x)}$ is a negative literal with the &lt;strong&gt;constant symbol&lt;/strong&gt; 2, the &lt;strong&gt;variable symbols&lt;/strong&gt; x, y, the &lt;strong&gt;function symbol&lt;/strong&gt;s f, g, and the &lt;strong&gt;predicate symbol&lt;/strong&gt; Q.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;t: $v$  $f^{n}$  $a$&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;注意term是变量而非字面量，如x+y，而不是p+q&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;sσ &amp;#x3D; tσ&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resolution was originally developed as a method for automatic theorem proving. Later, it was discovered that a restricted form of resolution can be used for programming a computation. This approach is called logic programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;program&lt;/strong&gt; is expressed as &lt;strong&gt;a set of clauses&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;query&lt;/strong&gt; is expressed as &lt;strong&gt;an additional clause&lt;/strong&gt; that can &lt;strong&gt;clash&lt;/strong&gt;冲突 with one or more of the program clauses. &lt;strong&gt;The query is assumed to be the negation of result of the program&lt;/strong&gt;. If a refutation succeeds, the &lt;strong&gt;query&lt;/strong&gt; is not a &lt;strong&gt;logical consequence&lt;/strong&gt; of the program, so its &lt;strong&gt;negation&lt;/strong&gt; must be a &lt;strong&gt;logical consequence&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;解析最初是作为一种自动定理证明的方法而开发的。后来，人们发现，一种受限制的决议形式可以用于计算的编程。这种方法被称为逻辑编程。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;一个程序被表达为一组子句&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;一个查询被表达为一个额外的子句，可以与一个或多个程序子句发生冲突。查询被认为是对程序结果的否定。如果反驳成功，查询不是程序的逻辑结果，所以它的否定必须是一个逻辑结果&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;From-Formulas-in-Logic-to-Logic-Programming&quot;&gt;1. From Formulas in Logic to Logic Programming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;program clauses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;按我的理解就是霍恩子句&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;goal clause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose now that we have a set of program clauses and we want to prove that some formula:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$G_1\land{}…\land{}G_n$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is a &lt;strong&gt;logical consequence&lt;/strong&gt; of the set. This can be done by taking the negation of the formula:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\lnot{}G_1\lor{}…\lor{}\lnot{}G_n$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and refuting it by resolution with the program clauses&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula $¬ G_1∨⋯∨¬ G_n$ , called a &lt;strong&gt;goal clause&lt;/strong&gt;, consists entirely of negative literals, so it can only clash on the single positive literal of a program clause&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h2><blockquote><p>Temporal logic is a formal system for reasoning about time. Temporal logic has found extensive application in computer science, because the behavior of both hardware and software is a function of time.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Temporal logics are related to formal systems called modal logics. Modal logics express the distinction between what is necessarily true and what is possibly true. For example, the statement ‘7 is a prime number’ is necessarily true because—given the definitions of the concepts in the statement—the statement is true always and everywhere. In contrast, the statement the head of state of this country is a king is possibly true, because its truth changes from place to place and from time to time. Temporal logic and modal logic are related because ‘always’ is similar to ‘necessarily’ and ‘eventually’ to ‘possibly’.</p><p>时间逻辑与称为模态逻辑的形式系统有关。模态逻辑表达了什么是必然真实和什么是可能真实之间的区别。例如，”7是质数 “这个陈述必然是真实的，因为–考虑到陈述中概念的定义–这个陈述总是真实的，而且无处不在。相比之下，这个国家的国家元首是国王的说法可能是真的，因为它的真理在不同的地方和不同的时间会发生变化。时间逻辑和模态逻辑是相关的，因为 “总是 “类似于 “必然”，”最终 “类似于 “可能”。</p></blockquote><ul><li>时间逻辑与模态逻辑相似，只是<strong>状态</strong>被认为是指定在某一特定时间点上的真实情况，而<strong>转换</strong>则定义了时间的流逝</li></ul><h2 id="PTL">2.

    <summary type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;Introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temporal logic is a formal system for reasoning about time. Temporal logic has found extensive application in computer science, because the behavior of both hardware and software is a function of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temporal logics are related to formal systems called modal logics. Modal logics express the distinction between what is necessarily true and what is possibly true. For example, the statement ‘7 is a prime number’ is necessarily true because—given the definitions of the concepts in the statement—the statement is true always and everywhere. In contrast, the statement the head of state of this country is a king is possibly true, because its truth changes from place to place and from time to time. Temporal logic and modal logic are related because ‘always’ is similar to ‘necessarily’ and ‘eventually’ to ‘possibly’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;时间逻辑与称为模态逻辑的形式系统有关。模态逻辑表达了什么是必然真实和什么是可能真实之间的区别。例如，”7是质数 “这个陈述必然是真实的，因为–考虑到陈述中概念的定义–这个陈述总是真实的，而且无处不在。相比之下，这个国家的国家元首是国王的说法可能是真的，因为它的真理在不同的地方和不同的时间会发生变化。时间逻辑和模态逻辑是相关的，因为 “总是 “类似于 “必然”，”最终 “类似于 “可能”。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;时间逻辑与模态逻辑相似，只是&lt;strong&gt;状态&lt;/strong&gt;被认为是指定在某一特定时间点上的真实情况，而&lt;strong&gt;转换&lt;/strong&gt;则定义了时间的流逝&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;PTL&quot;&gt;2. PTL&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;Syntax&quot;&gt;2.1. Syntax&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The syntax of propositional temporal logic (PTL) is defined like the syntax of propositional logic, &lt;strong&gt;except for the addition of two additional unary operators&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;□&lt;/code&gt; , read always&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;◊&lt;/code&gt; , read eventually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$(¬ ◊p)∧(□¬ q)$&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the temporal operators and negation have higher precedence优先权 than the conjunction operator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;semantic&quot;&gt;2.2. semantic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Informally, □ is a universal operator meaning ‘&lt;strong&gt;for any time t in the future&lt;/strong&gt;’, while ◊ is an existential operator meaning ‘&lt;strong&gt;for some time t in the future&lt;/strong&gt;’&lt;/li&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verification is routinely used when developing computer hardware and concurrent programs. A sequential program can always be tested and retested, but the nondeterministic nature of hardware and concurrent programs limits the effectiveness of testing as a method to demonstrate that the system is correct. Slight variations in timing, perhaps caused by congestion on a network, mean that two executions of the same program might give different results. Even if a bug is found by testing and then fixed, we have no way of knowing if the next test runs correctly because we fixed the bug or because the execution followed a different scenario, one in which the bug cannot occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在开发计算机硬件和并发程序时，经常会用到验证。一个顺序程序总是可以被测试和重新测试，但硬件和并发程序的非确定性限制了测试作为证明系统正确的方法的有效性。&lt;strong&gt;时间上的微小变化，也许是由网络上的拥堵造成的，意味着同一个程序的两次执行可能会得到不同的结果。即使通过测试发现了一个错误，然后进行了修复，我们也没有办法知道下一次测试的正确运行是因为我们修复了这个错误，还是因为执行了一个不同的场景，在这个场景中，这个错误不会发生&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;顺序程序的验证貌似没有用到时态逻辑&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Concurrent-Program-并发程序&quot;&gt;1. Concurrent Program 并发程序&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;concurrent program&lt;/strong&gt; is a set of &lt;strong&gt;sequential programs&lt;/strong&gt; together with a set of &lt;strong&gt;global variables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A concurrent program is a set of &lt;code&gt;processes&lt;/code&gt; ${ p_1,p_2,…,p_n }$, where each &lt;strong&gt;process&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;strong&gt;sequential program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processes&lt;/strong&gt; are also known as &lt;strong&gt;threads&lt;/strong&gt;; in some contexts, the two terms have different meanings but the difference is not relevant here&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;进程与线程在此处无需区别&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The variables declared in each process are its &lt;code&gt;local variables&lt;/code&gt;; a local variable can be read and written only by the process where it is declared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There may be &lt;code&gt;global variables&lt;/code&gt; that can be read and written by all of the processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;state-状态&quot;&gt;1.1. state 状态&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The state of a concurrent programs consists of &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the values of its variables&lt;/strong&gt; (both local and global),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;together with the &lt;strong&gt;location counters&lt;/strong&gt; of its processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/posts/cf619a86/2.png&quot; width=&quot;550&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;/posts/cf619a86/3.gif&quot; width=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are $5×3×3&amp;#x3D;45$ different states, because the variable n can have the values $0, 1, 2, 3, 4$ and there are &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; labels for &lt;strong&gt;each&lt;/strong&gt; process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These seems like quite a large number of states for such a simple program, but many of the states (for example, (0,end,end)) will never occur in any computation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We extend the deductive systems $G$ and $H$ from propositional logic to first-order logic by adding axioms and rules of inference &lt;strong&gt;for the universal quantifier&lt;/strong&gt;全称量词.&lt;/li&gt;

    <summary type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;引入&quot;&gt;1. 引入&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;命题逻辑对于算术等数学理论的形式化来说，表现力并不充分。一个算术表达式，如$x+2&amp;gt;y-1$，既不是真的，也不是假的。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;它的真假取决于变量x和y的值&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;我们需要将运算符+和-的含义形式化，作为将一对数字映射为一个数字的函数&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;像&amp;gt;这样的关系运算符必须被形式化为将一对数字映射为真值 (也就是predicate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;命题逻辑vs一阶逻辑&quot;&gt;2. 命题逻辑vs一阶逻辑&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;命题逻辑（Propositional Logic） &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;形如 ¬P，P∧Q，P∨Q，P → Q ，P↔Q的语句，值为True或者False&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;推理规则较简单，往往通过（1.真值表  2.为数不多的推理规则，例如Modus ponesn等几个）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;缺点：不能或者很难表示复杂的语句，不能记录推理过程中的变化&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;一阶逻辑（First Order Logic），简称FOL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;包含的东西有&lt;strong&gt;常量&lt;/strong&gt;（Constant symbol），&lt;strong&gt;谓词&lt;/strong&gt;符号（Predicate symbol），&lt;strong&gt;函数&lt;/strong&gt;符号（Function symbol），&lt;strong&gt;变量&lt;/strong&gt;（Variable），&lt;strong&gt;联结词&lt;/strong&gt;（来源于命题逻辑 ∧∨→↔），&lt;strong&gt;量词&lt;/strong&gt;（Quantifiers, ∃∀）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;命题逻辑(很少部分人叫它作零阶逻辑). 在命题逻辑里, 每一个字母就代表一个命题, 所以命题逻辑只能表达句子之间的关系, 比如“p&amp;amp;q”, “if p then q”等等的真值如何从p和q的真值中计算出来.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;一阶逻辑则引入了两个量词, 即universal quantifier(倒A)和existential quantifier(倒E), 并且加入了一阶谓词和individual variables和individual constants. 这些导致一阶逻辑可以量化individuals in the domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;比如经典的三段论就可以被一阶逻辑表达 &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight plaintext&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;For all x, Hx-&amp;gt;Mx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;Hs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;----&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;Ms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equality: no&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predicate symbols: A1, A2, . . .&lt;/li&gt;
